Bootcamp Repository

Ansible files for jumpbox are in /Ansible/jumpbox-vm folder

Ansible files for elk are in /Ansible/elk-vm folder

I did not do a diagram, however I included some screenshots from my Azure environment showing the virtual objects I did create and configure

The Linux Commands.txt file in the /Linux folder show the commands I used to get as far as creating and installing the playbook for ELK-VM
